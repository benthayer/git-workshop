I can’t think of a good comment so here’s a blueberry pancake recipe 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/4 cup granulated white sugar 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/8 teaspoon salt 3/4 cup milk + more to thin out the batter, as needed 1 large egg 1 Tablespoon vegetable oil 1/2 cup fresh or frozen blueberries maple syrup

    Whisk together first 4 ingredients; make a well in center of mixture.

    In a separate bowl, whisk together milk, egg, and oil; add to dry ingredients, stirring just until moistened. Gently fold in blueberries.

    Pour about 1/4 cup batter for each pancake onto a hot, lightly greased griddle. Cook pancakes until tops are covered with bubbles and edges look cooked; turn and cook other side. Serve with maple syrup.
